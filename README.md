## Sanus NeuroScaner

Sanus NeuroScaner is a project that aims to detect brain defects in infants using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes MRI scans to identify potential abnormalities in brain development.

## Features

- Automated detection of brain defects in infant MRI scans
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing MRI data
- Detailed reports highlighting areas of concern in the brain
- Ability to track patient progress over time
- Dealing with Doctors with APIs
- Dealing with patients with APIs
- Direct messaging with APIs
- Searching for patient , doctor
- Full Authentication with APIs
- identify potential abnormalities in brain development

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

## Sanus NeuroScaner

Sanus NeuroScaner is a project that aims to detect brain defects in infants using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes MRI scans to identify potential abnormalities in brain development.

## Features

- Automated detection of brain defects in infant MRI scans
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing MRI data
- Detailed reports highlighting areas of concern in the brain
- Ability to track patient progress over time

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Python[1]
- TensorFlow[1]
- Keras[1]
- NumPy[1]
- Matplotlib[1]
- Flask[1]
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript[1]
